Hi! My name is Laura and I did my Bachelor's in Biotechnology back in the university in my home country - Lithuania. During a summer internship in Dresden, where I worked with pathological images of breast tissue aiming to predict severity and progression of cancer, I got fascinated by the interdisciplinary environment of Dresden, so I came back here for my Master's in Molecular Bioengineering at CMCB, TU Dresden.

In 2021, I started working as a student assistant in the bio-image analysis technology development group led by Robert Haase at Physics of Life (PoL). My task was to develop a napari plugin, which would allow users to explore their data interactively using dimensionality reduction of extracted features from labelled images and clustering. As for my Master thesis, wanting to dive deeper into deep learning, I worked on instance segmentation for the multidimensional organoid data. 

On this blog I try to share my experience and things I learned during my time in the BiAPoL group. Bioimage analysis is a fascinating field, and I hope you find the things we write about helpful for you work! :)
